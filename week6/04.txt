Abstract—Smart manufacturing (SM) is emerging as a new 
version of intelligent manufacturing (IM), reflecting the 
magnitude and impact of smart technologies such the Internet of 
Things, Cloud Computing, Cyber-Physical Systems and Big Data 
on Industry 4.0. This paper addresses how IM evolves to SM 
along with artificial intelligence (AI) evolution. To this end, this 
study first summarizes how the symbolic AI (called AI 1.0) 
characterized by structured contents and centralized control 
structures evolves into the next-generation AI (called AI 2.0) 
characterized by unstructured contents, decentralized control 
structures and machine learning (especially deep learning), and 
explain show IM enabled by AI 1.0 evolves into SM by AI 2.0 
accordingly. Then, the comparison of IM and SM is discussed in 
detail. Finally, the further development of smart manufacturing

I. INTRODUCTION
Big Data has become an emerging field of AI (Artificial 
intelligence) for both academic and industrial communities 
over the past years. More specifically, Chen et al. divided the 
development of business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) 
into 3 stages: the first centered on DBMS (database 
management systems)-based structured content, called BI&A 
1.0, the second on text and web analytics for unstructured web 
content, called BI&A 2.0, and the third on mobile and sensorbased content, called BI&A 3.0 [1]. The amount of data 
generated continues to grow exponentially along with the 
digitalization of and use of the Internet of Things (IoT) in 
factories, and manufacturing is identified as one of the five 
domains in which Big Data has transformative potential [2].
Meanwhile, emerging is a new manufacturing model, 
called smart manufacturing, which attracts a huge amount of 
interest in both academic and industrial communities. The 
Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition (SMLC) defined it 
as "the intensified application of advanced intelligence 
systems to enable rapid manufacturing of new products, 
dynamic response to product demand, and real-time 
optimization of manufacturing production and supply-chain 
networks"[3].
As we know, there has existed so-called intelligent 
manufacturing (IM), which can be viewed as the 
implementation of AI in manufacturing. Then, what 
relationship exists between SM and IM as well as Big Data 
and AI? How do they evolve? This paper will try to answer 
these questions with aims to clarify SM and IM by addressing 
the current state of manufacturing intelligence/smart 
pertaining to next-generation AI, and to identify fields where 
intended efforts should be put on the next-generation 
intelligent manufacturing--smart manufacturing. 
II. AI EVOLUTION
Since AI was coined in 1956, the field of AI went through 
ups and downs in the ensuing decades, and experienced two 
major winters in 1974–80 and 1987–93 [4]. AI, can be roughly 
classified into symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches (e.g., 
neural networks, fuzzy sets, and evolutionary algorithms).
At the first wave, in the 1960s symbolic intelligence had 
won tremendous success at mimicking high-level thinking in 
small demo programs for solving "toy problems". Meanwhile, 
approaches based on neural networks or cybernetics were 
given up or pushed into the background [5]. Especially, the 
abandonment of connectionism in 1969 when Minsky and 
Papert published the book Perceptrons that outlined the limits 
of perceptrons [6], the large decrease in AI research in 
response to the Lighthill Report of 1973, and DARPA's 
funding cuts of the early 1970s, led AI to enter the first winter 
in 1974–80 [4]. 
In 1980s, expert systems (ESs) or knowledge-based 
systems (KBSs) got big success, in which there were 
knowledge bases that involve high-level, domain knowledge 
extracted from experts and expressed in specific structured 
formats. Applications were developed also in manufacturing 
[7] to solve complex problems of machine programming with 
multiple tools working simultaneously on the same workpiece. 
Such a need led to the emergence of knowledge 
engineering/knowledge representation that is central to classic 
AI research. Meanwhile, the "winter" of connectionist

research came to an end in the middle 1980s, when the work 
of Hopfield, Rumelhart and others revived large scale interest 
in neural networks. Thus, sub-symbolic approaches without 
specific representations of knowledge, e.g. neural networks 
(NNs), fuzzy sets, statistical and genetic algorithms (GA), 
began to get researchers' attention. As a result, sub-symbolic 
methods came into AI systems. Unfortunately, the second AI 
winter was triggered by the breakdown of the Lisp machine 
market in 1987, the revocation of new expenditure on AI by 
the Strategic Computing Initiative in 1988, the fizzle of the 
fifth generation computers, and the fall of expert systems in 
the early 1990s [4].
In the 1990s, distributed AI (DAI) got increasingly focused 
along with the emergence of multi agents (MAs), which made 
previous AI systems in centralized, hierarchical control 
structures become flat, and substituted by a set of loosely 
coupling agents collaborating with each other, interoperating 
about messages and mutually learning from experience. 
In the 2000s, Web 2.0, web services and web intelligence 
emerged in AI systems. The prevalence of the Internet resulted 
in large volumes of data available online. In addition, 
individuals or organizations produce a great deal of structured 
and unstructured data which are in need for processing. The 
storing and processing of such large volume of data reflects a
urgent need and a great challenge in mining, and processing 
this data as knowledge [8].
The on-going wave of interest for AI started around 2010, 
promoted by three factors associated with each other [9]: the 
sources of Big Data including e-commerce, social media, 
research community, organization, and government; the 
machine learning approaches and algorithms which have been 
dramatically improved based on raw material provided by Big 
Data; and the powerful computers which support the 
computing of Big Data. 
Such a disruptive progress is shifting the traditional AI 
(called AI 1.0), which emphasized symbolic approaches 
characterized by structured contents and centralized control 
structures, to enter a new version, called Artificial Intelligence 
2.0 (AI 2.0), which emphasizes machine learning (especially 
deep learning) characterized by unstructured contents and decentralized (distributed) control structures. Figure 1 briefly 
illustrates AI evolution from the perspective of content and 
control: from AI 1.0 (Symbolic AI), through either DAI 
(Distributed AI) called AI 1.5D or Web AI called AI 1.5W, to 
AI 2.0. 
In the process of AI evolution, there were more and more 
sub-symbolic approaches were added into. Although neural 
networks were revived in 1980s, AI was still dominated by 
symbolic approaches at that time. Later, the integration of 
conventional expert experience, artificial neural networks, 
evolutionary algorithms and fuzzy sets in various 
configuration resulted in the so-called hybrid expert systems. 
Neural networks facilitated the process of knowledge gaining 
in some extent by training patterns instead of loading rules. 
Evolutionary algorithms were used as efficient tools for 
addressing complicated practical engineering optimization 
tasks such as production scheduling problems. In 2010s, deep 
learning (DL) originated form neural networks has emerged, 
which manages to approach intelligence from large amounts 
of unstructured data such that overcomes, in some extent, the 
symbolic AI bottleneck problem that depends on knowledge 
extracting, which might be the most hard part of building an 
expert system. Due to the diversity of AI approaches and 
solutions, there is not a clear distinction between what AI 
approaches are applied. For example, in fuzzy systems 
knowledge is preserved in styles of symbolic feature, while 
implemented as a neuron-like numerical procedure in neural 
networks. And intelligent agents can use both symbolic and 
sub-symbolic approaches. Therefore, between AI 1.0 and AI 
2.0 as shown in Fig. 2(a), there is a transition, called 1.5X,
which includes 1.5D and 1.5W as shown in Fig. 1.

wave of computing began when mainframe computers were 
used in 1950-60s to manage companies' operations. Then in 
1980-90s, personal computers rose and carried over the jobs 
such as expert systems that had been deployed in expensive 
special-purpose machines, which might lead to a false 
impression of the so-called "the fall of the Lisp machine 
market" [10]. Now, in 2010s, we are entering a new age of the 
IoT, cloud computing, pervasive computing or ubiquitous 
computing, which results in the emergence of Big Data. There 
is a need of new AI tools to collect and analyze such Big Data. 
To summarize the above discussion, AI evolution is given

III. FROM INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING TO SMART 
MANUFACTURING ALONG AI EVOLUTION
A. Intelligent manufacturing 
For simplicity, intelligent manufacturing (IM) can be 
viewed as the intersection of AI and manufacturing. Thus, IM 
progresses along with the development of AI as shown in Fig. 
3. In IM field, the first book, Manufacturing Intelligence, was 
published in 1988 [11], and then we witnessed applications of 
the methods, techniques and paradigms of AI in 
manufacturing, resulting in the emergence of many specific 
IM systems such as those in design, scheduling, production, 
inspection, diagnosis, modeling, and control [12], during the 
second AI waves shown in Fig. 2(a).

There are research papers tackled with the implementation 
of AI in manufacturing industry. For example, Teti and 
Kumara [12] surveyed the relevant AI methods introduced in 
manufacturing before 1997, and grouped them as follow:
Knowledge-based/Expert systems (KBSs/ESs), Neural 
Networks (NNs), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Multi Agents (MAs), and 
others such as Evolutionary Algorithms and Simulated 
Annealing (SA). The AI applications resulted in intelligent 
components for CIM such as intelligent CAX (e.g. CAD, CAP, 
CAM, and CAQ) as well as in intelligent robots [13]. In the 
early years of intelligent manufacturing system (IMS) 
development, KBSs/ESs had attracted much more attention, 
and later NNs, case-based reasoning, GA and FL attracted 
attention, too [14]. KBSs/ESs were introduced efficiently in 
CIM components, while IMS was partially introduced in 
industry but mainly for large companies [13]. The most 
famous IMS research was the international scheme of joint 
research, called Intelligent Manufacturing System found in 
1995 and originally dated back to 1989 from Japan [15],
whose members come from Japan, US, EU and other 
industrial countries. 
In 1990s, Agent-based systems for intelligent 
manufacturing [16] had emerged, followed by web-services 
based systems for manufacturing [17] as well as Enterprise 2.0 
[18] and crowdsourcing [19] in 2000s. The agent-based 
method seemed to be the potential solution as it offered a 
proper paradigm for the intelligent CIM components and IMS, 
and more detail can be seen in [20-22]. Intelligent agents are 
used in distributed AI (DAI), and such an agent-based DAI 
approach has the ability to handle the issues of the present 
software applications, specifically those working conditions 
that are highly dynamic and uncertain [23]. However, most 
agent-based systems are still at a research and prototype stage 
in labs and not widely adopted in manufacturing. 
B. Smart manufacturing 
In 2010s, instead of intelligent technologies (Symbolic AI) 
in manufacturing, we are seeing a similar convergence of 
"smart" technologies (called "smart AI" in contrast to 
Symbolic AI) in manufacturing with the potential to radically 
improve the management of manufacturing enterprises in the 
product life cycle so as to provide more options for customers 
[24], as shown in Fig. 3.

The technologies used for the implementation of smart 
manufacturing span a wide spectrum of domains, which are 
initially referred as the IoT technologies [25], and then many 
other related techniques such as Internet of Services (IoS), 
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Big Data, and advanced 
robotics are added into. These smart technologies are taking 
center stage in the second generation intelligent manufacturing 
(IM 2.0.), i.e. smart manufacturing. The rise of IoT/CPS and 
smart objects (phones) has made products become more 
networked and accessible, from which the wealth of data 
generated allows accurate targeting and further enabling 
proactive management of enterprises through informed, timely, 
in-depth decision execution [24]. Moreover, the fusion of 
human, data and smart/intelligent algorithms has far-reaching 
effects on manufacturing efficiency. 
Of these smart terms, Big Data emphasizes data analysis,
while CPS covers a larger scope compared to IoT or IoS, and 
becomes increasingly important in manufacturing context [26]. 
Figure 4 exemplifies smart manufacturing as a cyber-physical 
production system, which is viewed as the combination of IoT
and IoS. In the cyber space such as in cloud, manufacturing 
related resources are virtualized and packaged as cloud 
services that can be shared and utilized on demand via IoS. As
there exists large amount of manufacturing services, and a
single service usually cannot satisfy complicated task 
requirements, it is necessary to solve such a so-called service 
composition and optimal selection problem in order to form a 
business process for manufacturing by using intelligent 
optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization,
differential evolution, and bee colony algorithm. Then the 
optimized business process created in the cyber system is 
delivered to the physical shop floor for execution by linking 
each cloud manufacturing service (virtual machine) to its 
corresponding physical machine. Meanwhile, the status in the 
physical workshop is sensed via IoT to the cyber system to 
track if the business process is fulfilled or not.

IV. COMPARISON OF IM AND SM
The traditional IM systems are centralized in configuration 
with structured contents such as in database, knowledge base, 
intelligent CAD (ICAD), ICAP, and ICAM, and usually used 
in departments of an enterprise on a relatively small scale. 
Meanwhile, agent technology promotes distributed AI in 
manufacturing. With the development of the Internet, 
manufacturing enterprises have shifted to the Web to sell and 
promote their products, which leads to the emergence of 
unstructured data of social media. Later, advances in the 
Internet of Things and Services, smart technologies are 
becoming increasingly utilized by industry, which results in 
the emergence of smart manufacturing, and makes enterprises 
face the challenge of exponential growing Big Data. As such, 
enterprises need to utilize Big Data related techniques for 
predicting, proactive maintenance, and production.
Nevertheless, such Big Data analytics is not available in 
traditional, even in agent- or web- based manufacturing 
systems, due to their limitation of data acquisition and 
processing capabilities [27]. 
As stated above, traditional IM is based on symbolic AI, 
which seeks to integrate human experience and knowledge in
manufacturing, usually extracted from experts in production.
In traditional IM systems, human experience/knowledge is 
expressed by the IF-THEN production systems or other 
formatted ways (e.g., frames, objects, and semantic). However, 
Big Data generated in SM is out of the processing capability 
of traditional database systems and software tools. Thus, Big 
Data analytics becomes critical to enterprises in order to turn 
raw data to actionable information, and/or knowledge that 
helps decision making [28].
As shown in Fig. 5, IM is knowledge-based while SM is 
data-driven and knowledge-enabled. Data and knowledge are 
related in the hierarchy of Data, Information, Knowledge and 
Wisdom (DIKW hierarchy). The emergence of "Big Data
(analytics)" makes decision makers in enterprises shift their 
focus from knowledge back to "data" [28]. Owing to huge data 
volumes being processed, predictive models and decision 
emerging there from are based on machine learning [28],
especially deep learning, which can be used to abstract highlevel representations from large amounts of data [29].

Therefore, in Big Data era, decision making is driven by 
predictions - learning from data (experience) to predict, and 
actions are taken in response to predictions [30]. Machine 
learning, which learns from data and uses statistical 
approaches to assist decision making that operates well in 
practice, contrasts with the older "expert system" approach
that aims to mimic the rules from human experts with the help 
of programmers translating the explicit rules into software 
code.
Now, there is an increasing growing of literature on Big 
Data in manufacturing as be seen from surveyed in the last 
few years especially after 2012 [31]. There is a profound 
distinct between Big Data and structured data in DBMS. Big 
Data is unstructured large scale data sets that is hard to be 
processed by traditional software tools within a tolerable 
elapsed time [32], characterized by a high Volume, Velocity 
and Variety to need new emerging approaches for its 
conversion into Value [33]. Although BI&A is divided into 3 
stages from the viewpoint of data structures/sources as stated 
above, both BI&A 2.0 and 3.0 are related to Big Data, and 
they differ only in the data sources. 
As stated above, we address AI or intelligent 
manufacturing in two stages. Before 2000 we usually referred 
the application of AI in manufacturing as intelligent 
manufacturing (IM), but now smart manufacturing is 
increasingly used, instead, as next-generation manufacturing 
model with the smart sensing and control techniques [34]. At 
first, the smart factory was initially studied with the 
application of IoT in production [35], and later becomes a key 
part of Industry 4.0 (Industrie 4.0) [36]. Then, more and more 
"smart" techniques such as the IoS, cloud computing, and CPS 
were also introduced to the smart factory or smart 
manufacturing [37].
Now, the term "smart" involves the creation and use of 
data throughout the entire product cycle for the purpose of 
more flexible manufacturing processes that respond quickly to 
on-demand changes at low cost without harming the 
environment [38]. It is the introduction of those technologies 
that makes manufacturing become "smart" and different from 
the "older" intelligent manufacturing. Among those, IoT and 
CPS are, in a sense, acronymous, both of which try to connect 
the cyber world and the physical world, and result in large 
scale data set - Big Data. SM's strength lies in implementing
manufacturing intelligence (MI) from a comprehensive global
viewpoint under the support of ICT technologies including
IoT, IoS, CPS and Big Data that were not available previously.
As such, Davis et al. defined SM as "the use of data-driven MI 
in multiple real-time applications deployed throughout all 
operating layers across the factory and supply chain" [39],
and the future enterprise as "data driven, knowledge enabled,
and model rich with visibility across the enterprise such that 
all operating actions are executed proactively by applying the 
best information and performance metrics" [34].
Such ubiquitous use or access of mined information/ 
knowledge out of Big Data throughout the entire product value 
chain, from product lines to the demand-supply networks,
supports new services and business models such as 
"Everything-as-a-Service" and "Pay-per-use" as in cloudbased design and manufacturing [27]. So "Design-as-aService" and "Product-as-a-Service" can be accessible on
demand. As such, we are entering the next-generation 
intelligent manufacturing – smart manufacturing, in which 
factories have the ability to sense, understand, think, and 
respond to our needs. The comparison of IM and SM is given 
in Table II, from which we can see that SM provides
significantly more benefits than IM.

V. FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF SMART MANUFACTURING FOR 
INDUSTRY 4.0 
The term "Industry 4.0" originates from the high-tech 
program of the German government, which derives from 
"smart factories" [40]. Following the first Industrial 
Revolution "Mechanization", the second "Mass production", 
and the third "Automation", Industry 4.0 emerges through the 
utilization of CPS, IoT and IoS [41, 42]. 
Smart factories (manufacturing) and Industry 4.0 are 
empowering each other, both often described in CPS 
architectures [41, 43-46]. However, the CPS architecture is not 
sufficient for Industry 4.0 or a manufacturing system, which is, 
by its very nature, socio-technical. Similar to Industry 4.0 
proposed by Germany, "Made in China 2025 Strategy" also 
focuses on intelligent (smart) manufacturing [47]. Moreover, 
there is an increasing need of customized/personalized 
products and sustainable manufacturing [48], as well as the 
emergence of Enterprise 2.0, socialized enterprises, 
crowdsourcing, social manufacturing, and open innovation, so 
social dimension should be as well considered in smart 
manufacturing/smart factories/ Industry 4.0 [49], as illustrated 
in Fig. 6. To meet such needs, wisdom manufacturing (or wise 
manufacturing) in the form of social CPS (SCPS) was 
proposed [50, 51].

The previous three industrial revolutions tried to promote 
or focused on mass production, while Industry 4.0 focuses on 
mass customization/personalization. Therefore, Industry 4.0 
somehow represents a socio-technical revolution, converting 
the previous technical revolution into a socio-technical one 
through the introduction of smart manufacturing technologies 
and the convergence with social intelligence and human 
wisdom such as social computing, collective intelligence,
crowdsourcing, and innovation. And SCPS-based 
manufacturing can be viewed as the extension of CPS-based 
manufacturing (including smart manufacturing and 3D 
printing, which naturally revives craft production in the CPS 
form) by adding the social dimension [49] , as shown in Fig. 6.

Wisdom manufacturing integrated IoT, IoS, Internet of 
Contents and Knowledge (IoCK), and Internet of People (IoP)
in manufacturing context [51]. IoCK can be seen as DIKW, 
Internet of Knowledge, or Internet of data (Big Data). Thus, 
IoT, IoS, IoCK, and IoP can grouped as IoTSKP (Internet of 
Things, Services, Knowledge, and People). Most new 
emerging manufacturing models focus on one or two aspects 
of IoTSKP, for example, smart factory on IoT, cloud 
manufacturing on IoS (cloud computing), Enterprise 2.0/ 
crowdsourcing on IoP, predictive manufacturing on Big Data 
[52], and CPS-based smart manufacturing [53]. Wisdom 
manufacturing is such a model that integrates the ideas of 
these emerging models together, as shown in Fig. 7. 
The integration of IoT, IoS, and IoP in manufacturing 
leads to the rapid rise of available data sets, with which 
enterprises are overwhelmed. Big Data is what these emerging 
manufacturing models have in common. On the one hand, Big 
Data as data-intensive computing, provides us a new paradigm 
beyond experimental and theoretical research and computer 
simulations of natural phenomena [54] to rethink what it 
means to AI or intelligent (smart) manufacturing. But on the 
other hand, Big Data is considered as one of the greatest 
challenges that 21st-century enterprises have to face. So it is 
an urgently demand and predictive challenge to turn Big Data 
into actionable information/knowledge for these emerging 
manufacturing models.

As shown in Fig. 8, SCPS-based manufacturing (wisdom

systems as a whole, which covers 6 semiotic levels - from 
physical to social, and generates data from [55]: (1) the social 
system that consists in the IoP including social media 
networks, Web 2.0, crowdsourcing communities and mobiles; 
(2) the cyber system that consists in the IoCK, and IoS
including digitalization of manufacturing such as NC/CAD/ 
CAM/CAE/CAPP/PDM/ERP, simulation, and virtual 
manufacturing; and (3) the physical system that consists in the 
IoT including sensors and smart objects. 
Now, this is a trend to blend "symbolic" AI with "smart" 
AI, which will result in hybrid AI called "wise" AI or 
Artificial Wisdom. As such, AI evolves from "symbolic" (AI 
1.0) to "smart" (AI 2.0), and further to "wise" (AI 3.0). In a 
sense, AI 3.0 can be viewed as the combination of symbolic 
AI, smart AI and others. Namely, we have " wise AI (AI 3.0) 
= smart AI (AI 2.0) + symbolic AI (AI 1.0) + others".
Similarly, manufacturing is evolving from intelligent to smart, 
and will to wise (wisdom). 
As the further development of smart manufacturing, wise 
(wisdom ) manufacturing integrates not only symbolic AI and 
smart technologies (smart AI) but also human 
intelligence/wisdom in manufacturing, more specifically 
integrating humans, computers and machines/things, 
ubiquitous/artificial/collective intelligence, as well as human 
knowledge/experience as a whole [50].
